### What is Polyhacks
Polyhacks is a [hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCyFxcMsjnA) hosted at Florida Polytechnic University once a year by the members of SHAPE. The event is entirely student run and if anyone is interested in assisting in the planning and operation of the event please get in contact with a member of the eBoard. This years hackathon should take place on November 2nd and 3rd in the IST commons.

### Workshops
During this meeting we provided a brief description of each of the workshops similar to the descriptions provided on the main page of this site. Then, we took a Strawpoll and confirmed the Server/API Development workshop is going to be the first event hosted by SHAPE. We also talked about how you can get in contact with us if you would like to host your own workshop. Finally, we discussed being able to order Chick-fil-a for workshops. If anyone has a food allergy, please make sure to inform the eBoard prior to the workshop so we can accommodate you. If anyone plans to attend a workshop and they signup 2 weeks prior to the event they are guaranteed to have food at the meeting.
