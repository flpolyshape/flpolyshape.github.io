# SHAPE's Github Pages site
Github Pages Website for SHAPE at Florida Polytechnic University

This is designed to be a simple site that we can use for links to resources for workshops, or other various things.

One of the neat things about this site is that as soon as a new markdown file is added to the root of the repo, it will be scanned for metadata every time the template of the webpage is loaded. If it finds a tag that looks like `<meta pagename="Page Name" />` in it, it will automatically add it to the navigation area on the left or top of the page, depending on the type of device you're using.
