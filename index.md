- [Android App Exploitation](#android-app-exploitation)
- [Server/API Development](#serverapi-development)
- [Git Basics](#git-basics)
- [Advanced Git Practices](#advanced-git-practices)


### Android Development
#### Required Supplies
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- An Android Device or Emulator
#### Description
A series of workshops where we go over the basics of designing and developing an Android app, and trying to implement some of the industry best practices along the way. We'll start out with some simple stuff, then begin to get more advanced.

### Android App Exploitation
#### Required Supplies
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- An Android Device or Emulator
- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/releases) [(source code)](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
- [DIVA](https://payatu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/diva-beta.tar.gz) [(source code)](https://github.com/payatu/diva-android)
#### Description
A series of workshops where we go over the basics of exploiting Android apps, and what not to do when designing your own app. These workshops will go pretty well if you're also in the Android Development workshops. We will be using DIVA, a learning tool designed to be exploitable. We will start with some of the more simple challenges, and work towards the later ones along the way.

### Server/API Development
#### Required Supplies
- Laptop
#### Description
A short series of workshops where we go over the basic structure of an API, introduce how RESTful APIs work, and teach you how to build your own API that responds to requests. If interest is high enough we will then teach how to integrate databases into your API. This kind of knowledge is critical if you want to work as a Backend Developer when you graduate college.

### Git Basics
#### Required Supplies
- Laptop or PC with nearly any modern OS on it
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [(source code)](https://github.com/git/git)
#### Description
A workshop that will go over the basics of what git is, how and when to use it, and we will also teach you a few basic git commands. This workshop will be followed-up by "Advanced Git Practices".

### Advanced Git Practices
#### Required Supplies
- Laptop or PC with nearly any modern OS on it
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [(source code)](https://github.com/git/git)
- Workshop attendees are recommended to have attended "Git Basics" previously
#### Description
A workshop that will go over the more advanced features of git, such as branch switching, cherry-picking, handling merge confflicts, rebasing, reverting, and resetting. Attendees of this workshop are strongly recommended to have attended "Git Basics" before attending.
